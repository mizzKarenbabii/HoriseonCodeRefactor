I am working on the code refact for the site Horiseon. Looking through the code I saw some things that needed to be changed like no alts for images, no specific name for the website and alot of repeating elements for the css page that could be compressed. 

Things I have changed:
1. i changed the <title> from website to Horiseon.
2. i added the class = " search-engine-optimization" to line 29 in HTML page
3. i added alt's to the images 
4.
